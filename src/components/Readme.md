# Components

This is the place where the stateless components are created.
They are meant to be called in `src/controllers` or `src/modules/ExampleModule` folders.

Each components should have :

- A corresponding doc (located in `src/components/__docs__/*`) For Storybook or Styleguidist
- A corresponding test (located in `components/__tests__/*`) For React testing library or Jest

Components can be called in a container or module.
